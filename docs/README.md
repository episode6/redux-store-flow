StoreFlow is a kotlin multiplatform "port" of [Redux for Javascript](https://redux.js.org/) / [ReduxKotlin](https://reduxkotlin.org/) that is backed by kotlin's coroutines and Flows. While we use much of the same terminology as the aforementioned projects, the api and implementation differ significantly.
